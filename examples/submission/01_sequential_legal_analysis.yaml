# SUBMISSION EXAMPLE 1: Sequential Workflow with Persistent Memory
# Demonstrates: Sequential agent execution + Shared memory between agents
# Use Case: Legal Contract Analysis Pipeline

name: legal_contract_analyzer
description: |
  Sequential legal contract analysis workflow.
  Each agent receives context from previous agents via shared memory.
  Demonstrates how later agents can reference findings from earlier agents.

agents:
  - id: contract_reader
    role: Legal Document Specialist
    model: openai
    goal: Parse and extract key information from the contract
    instruction: |
      Extract and structure the following from the contract context:
      
      - Parties involved (names, roles)
      - Contract type and purpose
      - Key dates (effective date, expiration, renewal dates)
      - Financial terms (amounts, payment schedules, penalties)
      - Key clauses and obligations
      
      Format as clear bullet points for other team members.

  - id: risk_analyzer
    role: Legal Risk Analyst
    model: openai
    goal: Identify potential legal risks and liabilities
    instruction: |
      Using the contract information from shared memory:
      
      Analyze and identify:
      - Potential legal risks and liabilities
      - Unfavorable terms or clauses
      - Hidden obligations or penalties
      - Compliance concerns
      - Termination risks
      
      Rate each risk as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW.

  - id: negotiation_advisor
    role: Contract Negotiation Expert
    model: openai
    goal: Recommend negotiation strategies based on analysis
    instruction: |
      Using contract details AND risk analysis from shared memory:
      
      Provide:
      - Strategic negotiation recommendations
      - Clauses to push back on
      - Counter-proposal suggestions
      - Key points to protect
      - Walk-away triggers
      
      Reference specific risks identified by the risk analyzer.

  - id: summary_writer
    role: Executive Summary Writer
    model: openai
    goal: Create an executive-ready summary of all findings
    instruction: |
      Using ALL previous analyses from shared memory:
      
      Create an executive summary including:
      
      1. CONTRACT OVERVIEW
         - Key parties and purpose
         - Critical dates and amounts
      
      2. RISK ASSESSMENT
         - Top 3 risks (from risk_analyzer)
         - Risk mitigation steps
      
      3. NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
         - Key recommendations
         - Priority action items
      
      4. GO/NO-GO RECOMMENDATION
         - Clear recommendation with justification
      
      This summary will be presented to the executive team.
